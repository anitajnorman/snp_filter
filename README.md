# snp_filter
Simple customizable R script for filtering SNPs from Stacks output files

SNPs can be filtered for the following:

- number of SNPs per read
- number of base pairs in the flanking sequence (for primer design)
- minimum number of individuals the SNP has been identified in
- minimum minor allele frequency

Note: The order is important and should not be changed
